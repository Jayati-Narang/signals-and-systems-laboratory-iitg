* Objective
  - To download the contents of "Download" tab of the "Sampling and signal reconstruction" experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/signals-and-systems-laboratory-iitg/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Sampling%20and%20signal%20reconstruction/sampling_01_usability_smk.org][sampling_01_usability_smk.org]] 

* Post conditions
   - Nil

* Test Steps
  1. Refer to sampling_22_download_p1.org 
  2. Click on "Sampling of band limited signal:Nyquist theorem" link
  3. Click on "Sampling of non band limited signal:Anti aliasing filter" link
  4. Click on "Signal reconstruction from its samples" link
  5. Click on "Frequency domain sampling:DFT" link
  6. Click on "Spectral analysis using DFT" link

* Expected result
  1. Download page should be opened
  2. Content of "Sampling of band limited signal:Nyquist theorem" should get downloaded.
  3. Content of "Sampling of non band limited signal:Anti aliasing filter" should get download.
  4. Content of "Signal reconstruction from its samples" should get downloaded.
  5. Content of "Frequency domain sampling:DFT" should get downloaded.
  6. Content of "Spectral analysis using DFT" should get downloaded.
