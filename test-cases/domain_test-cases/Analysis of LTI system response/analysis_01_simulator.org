* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulator link 
  2. Click on "LabVIEW Run Time Engine (Windows)".
  3. Click on "Download the Experiment .exe file".
  4. Cick on "Convolution and correlation of continuous-time signal".
  5. Extract the zip file and run the application.exe file.
  6. Repeat step 4 & 5 for "Convolution and correlation of discrete-time signal" link


* Expected result
  1. Simulator page should be opened
  2. Labview Run time engine should get downloaded on the pc and it is to be installed on your system.
  3. It redirects to the "Download" tab.
