* Objective
  - To view the Simulator of the "Fourier Analysis of signals" experiment

* Pre conditions
  - 1. Open the url vlabs.ac.in and vlabs home page is displayed 
    2. Click on IIT-Guwahati and a list of labs is displayed on the screen 
    3. Select Signals and Systems Lab, a home page is displayed and click on List of experiments link,  where a list of experiments will be displayed on the screen
    4. Selected  "Fourier Analysis of signals" experiment.

* Post conditions
   - Analysis of Fourier properties of Signals

* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulator link 
  2. Click on "LabVIEW Run Time Engine (Windows)".
  3. Click on "Download the Experiment .exe file".
  4. Cick on "Relationship between CTFS and CTFT (for periodic signal)".
  5. Extract the zip file and run the application.exe file.
  6. Repeat step 4 & 5 for for the other links present in the "Download" tab.


* Expected result
  1. Simulator page should be opened
  2. Labview Run time engine should get downloaded on the pc and it is to be installed on your system.
  3. It redirects to the "Download" tab.
  4. The zip file of "Relationship between CTFS and CTFT (for periodic signal)" gets downloaded in your system.
  5. The application.exe file should run without any error.
